## Goal

The objective of building this app was to learn about asynchronous programming in Dart. I learned about how to carry out time consuming tasks such as getting device location and networking to get data from the internet. 


## About the app

Clima is a weather app inspired by the beautiful designs made by [Olia Gozha](https://dribbble.com/shots/4663154-). Once installed, you'll be able to find out the live weather data in the current location of the device as well as the weather for any city you can think of!
